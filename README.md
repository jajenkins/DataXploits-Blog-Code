Code to reproduce the data visualizations on DataXploits blog

generally this code will be in R, occasionally python

For publically available data sets (I'll tend to use those for the analyses on the blog), I'll put the source location in the comments
of the file so that you can go get those.  You'll have to modify a line or two of the code (defining the directory where the data resides 
+ the name that you've used for the data file) to get that data accessible by the program.
